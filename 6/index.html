<h1>Why the Samsung Galaxy Book is the perfect Linux companion - 09/12/21</h1>
<p>I have been using my relatively new laptop since my birthday this year and as I've used it I have begun learning that this laptop is an ideal companion for almost any Linux user.</p>
<h2>Design and Hardware</h2>
<p>I personally love the design of the Samsung Galaxy Book. The laptop model I have has a 15 inch display along with a midnight blue case. The midnight blue case is very unique and looks very nice, and matches nicely with the Adwaita theme that GNOME provides.</p>
<p>The laptop has very Linux friendly hardware, with the CPU, GPU and Wireless card all being manufactured by Intel. The laptop has 8 gigabytes of RAM, which works perfectly with GNOME and other desktop environments as well. The laptop uses an 11th Generation, Intel i5 processor (11th Gen Intel i5-1135G7 (8) @ 4.200GHz) as well as an Intel TigerLake graphics card (Intel TigerLake-LP GT2 [Iris Xe Graphics]). The laptop uses the Intel AX201 wireless card which also works natively on Linux.</p>
<p>The laptop uses very Linux friendly hardware, with the CPU, GPU and wireless card all being manufactured by intel, which typically has native support on Linux. The laptop itself has 8 gigabytes of RAM, which I find is more than enough to use with GNOME and any other Desktop Environment. Along with this, the laptop uses an 11th Generation, Intel i5 processor as well as an Intel TigerLake graphics card. The laptop uses the Intel AX201 wireless card which works natively on Linux, however there are some issues with the wireless card that I will discuss later.</p>
<h2>My experience with the laptop on Fedora</h2>
<p>Fedora has probably been one of the best choices for Linux distributions that I could have chosen to use on this laptop. Due to the fact that the hardware on this laptop is very Linux-friendly, it allows me to take full advantage of all of the bleeding-edge technologies that Fedora pushes such as: Wayland, Pipewire, btrfs as well as the latest versions of GNOME. GNOME provides a lot of changes which make it one of the best desktop environments to use on a laptop. The trackpad gestures that GNOME provides are very intuitive and are made known to the user upon their first login to the system. The workspace oriented layout of GNOME makes it a much more pleasurable experience to use on a single monitor as it is easy to create, switch between and utilise workspaces into your workflow.</p>
<p>DNF is a very capable and easy-to-use package manager. A lot of Fedora users typically complain that DNF is too slow compared to other package managers such as APT and Pacman, however it can be sped up by enabling fastest mirror and parallel downloads. I personally feel that this should be enabled by default, however it is not a large issue. Fedora also provides Flatpak as a package manager for more graphical applications. The main issue I have with Fedora is that they do not enable the Flathub remote for Flatpak by default, instead preferring to provide their own Flatpak remote and allow the user to install the Flathub remote themselves. Due to the fact that Flathub is the main repository for Flatpak, and has a larger proportion of software when compared to the Fedora remote, I personally feel like it should be included in Fedora by default.</p>
<h2>Issues I have encountered with the Laptop</h2>
<p>One of the main issues I have encountered with this laptop is that the Intel AX201 Wireless drivers did not work on Pop!_OS 21.04. I wrote about this issue in another blog post <a href="https://mrbeebenson.github.io/5/">relating to Pop!_OS</a>. The issue with the AX201 Wireless card spans across many different Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Arch and Fedora. The issue with the drivers was fixed in a <a href="https://www.linuxcompatible.org/story/fedora-34-update-kernel5136200fc34/">kernel patch</a> for Fedora 34. Since Pop!_OS has recently upgraded their Kernel version to 5.15, the issue with the Wireless drivers may be fixed on their distribution too. Another issue I have experienced with the laptop is that the trackpad will ocassionally stop working entirely. When you enter the trackpad settings in the GNOME settings manager, no options will display. I am unsure what is currently causing the issue with the trackpad. Rebooting the laptop does not seem to fix the issue, however if you hold down the power button to force a shutdown, the trackpad will work again when you turn the device back on.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Despite some of the issues I have encountered whilst using this laptop, I still personally feel like the <a href="https://www.samsung.com/uk/pc/galaxy-book/galaxy-book-15inch-i5-8gb-256gb-np750xda-kc3uk/">Samsung Galaxy Book</a> is the perfect Linux companion. The Linux-friendly hardware allows you to choose between a wide-range of Linux distributions. This laptop is especially great if you are wanting to use Fedora, as you would be able to take full advantage of the bleeding-edge technologies, stability and enhancements for laptop users that Fedora and GNOME provide.</p>
