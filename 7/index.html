<h1>Reflecting on 2021, and looking ahead to 2022 - 02/01/22</h1>
<p>2021 was an eventful year, not just for myself but for the Linux desktop as a whole. For starters, I released my website in April of this year, with my first blog post about <a href="https://mrbeebenson.github.io/1">Why the Linux desktop is yet to be mainstream</a>. My personal life has changed a lot, Me and my girlfriend celebrated our first year together in September, and we recently moved in together. The shape of the Linux desktop has changed dramatically this year as GNOME, Fedora, Pop!_OS, Ubuntu and many other Linux distributions have large releases, and set out their vision for the future.</p>
<p>GNOME 40 marked a major shift in the GNOME foundations direction, the GNOME foundation are currently rolling out GTK4 and Libadwaita support across their desktop environment, and this is expected to continue into <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/rq2awk/what_to_expect_in_gnome_for_2022/">2022</a>. Fedora has shifted their focus from targetting developers, to becoming a distribution for everyone, and according to this reddit post <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/rq4mti/what_to_expect_for_fedora_workstation_in_2022/">&quot;What to expect for Fedora workstation in 2022&quot;</a> many changes will be coming to the Fedora desktop, including the prospect of becoming an immutable OS by default.</p>
<h2>What to expect from me in 2022.</h2>
<ul>
<li>New website design and blog post - 02/01/22</li>
</ul>
<p>With a new year being ushered in, I have decided to redesign my website and write this blog post. The website will take a slightly more conventional design, with the menubar being moved to the top of the website. The site will also adhere to the GNOME colour scheme, whilst still using the same accent colour to match applications on my desktop.</p>

<p>New website design</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Release of CruleOS 1 - April 2022</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's no secret that I've been working on a brand-new project, <a href="https://cruleos.github.io">CruleOS</a>. The distribution is expected to release sometime after Ubuntu 22.04 releases, in April. CruleOS is a Linux distribution aiming to provide a simple and easy use experience through a more traditional desktop, as well as utilising Flatpaks for easy application distribution, containerisation and updates as much as possible. CruleOS is built on-top of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS to provide a stable base for your desktop.</p>
<ul>
<li>More website development</li>
</ul>
<p>I have been designing a brand new website for the Mobian project which I intend to contribute to project. Development on the website has been staggered, however it is almost ready for release. I also aim to write more blog posts throughout this year, hopefully writing more than the 6 I have written in 2021.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>2021 has been a fantastic year, and while a lot of 2022 is certain, I will aim to continue providing as much content on my website as possible. I want to thank anyone who has contributed to my projects, or helped me learn more about the Linux desktop along the way. I wish everyone a happy new year, and make sure to stay safe and healthy.</p>
